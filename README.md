# Kaggle-LECR
see [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learning-equality-curriculum-recommendations) page for more details!

We chose a two-stage solution: uns_training -> retrieve ->  sup_training -> rerank -> inference

Final LB (private): 0.570 (97/1070)

It's not good enough but it's my first kaggle competition :)
